Nav is great, he is very responsive to all messages, and walks you through everything easily. No question is too stupid, Nav makes it easy to understand! With banks being slow to respond, and Nav putting up with my worrying, he did a great job! Thanks for all your help, I am now very happy in my own home!",

He is timely responsive and following up things well until getting the job done. It will be perfect if he got me alerted that bank would change interest so that I could move settlement date sooner. Overall, loansHub has helped me well. Highly recommended. NHP",

The platform is intuitive and the process was very smooth. We got our second home loan refinanced through LoansHub and both times, the process was easy and transparent. We had previously approached banks directly and also used other traditional brokers but our experience with LoansHub exceeded our expectations.",

        "review": "I have had the privilege of dealing with Nav and LoansHub and I can vouch for the following attributes in Nav which makes him my go-to Mortgage Broker\n\n1) Client First: No matter at what time I have reached out to Nav regarding his suggestion or inputs, he has always come back to me on time even if that meant late into after-hours\n\n2) Subject matter expertise: Nav is extremely proficient in matters related to housing Finance and brings with him a wealth of experience from the Banking Industry to help his clients get the best possible deals. He also uses his knowledge to advise clients keeping in mind their circumstances and works for the clients best interests which isn't always the case with other mortgage brokers\n\n3)Time efficient: Given the dynamic nature of deals in the real-estate industry and how split second decisions need to be made, Nav is very time efficient and always tries to work within the deadlines available, even if that means extending well beyond business hours.\n\n4)Smart Platform Set-up: He has what is possibly the best platform that one can expect their mortgage broker to have in a pandemic like situation with very limited face to face interaction. His platform allows him to have Video interactions with his clients thereby removing the need for a physical meeting. This is a great blessing for clients that are hard pressed for time and cannot afford to travel to the mortgage broker's office for meetings. All interactions that need to be recorded can be recorded for future references and his smart platform provides his prospective clients recommendations to think about an alternative product automatically as soon as one becomes available.\n\n\n\nAll in all, I have added a fabulous experience dealing with Nav and LoansHub and would highly recommend them!",
